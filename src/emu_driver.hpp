/*
 * emu_driver.hpp — drive rax to emulate the analyzed image and record the
 * control-flow edges and data accesses IDA's static pass could not resolve.
 *
 * This module is PURE rax: it includes no IDA headers and never touches the
 * database, so it is safe to run off the main thread against a pre-copied
 * ProgramImage. It produces raw addresses; classification into crefs/drefs and
 * the add-only-if-missing diff live in ref_discovery (which is on the DB side).
